# vault

Branch for initial project migration from CRA to Vite and overhaul

To Do before merge:
 - [ ] Add tags to projects and build filter functionality
 - [ ] Figure out how to find multiple images and display them (build an image carousel)
 - [ ] ^^^ also add larger / zoomed / modal style image viewer when images selected
 - [ ] ^^^ (Maybe) test adding a config file to project repos that can be pulled in and parsed to get images or tags etc
 - [ ] Add more pages (About page is first priority, figure out others later)
 - [ ] (At some point) Better styling and animations
 - [ ] (Maybe) cache images and descriptions in state to reduce traffic (hasn't been an issue yet)
 - [ ] ^^^ (Probably) add small and 720p thumbnails to projects to reduce load size for thumbnails
